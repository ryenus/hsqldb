This is a sandbox for pdinc.us and chiralsoftware.com, every thing is licensed under the HSQLDB license, but the items in this branch 
are in 
extreme flux, dont use it or use it at your own risk.

I would suggest you wait until parts are moved back to trunk, if they are.

Don't file a trouble ticket on sourceforge if it does not work, this is not what fred, et al are supporting.
