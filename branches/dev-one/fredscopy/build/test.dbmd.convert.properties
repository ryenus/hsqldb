## Note: 
##
## Most test.dbmd.convert properties have been moved to /org/hsqldb/resources
## under the test source folder and are now read using the bundle handler facility.
##
## System properties now take precedence, so you can use this file
## to override the values in the default test.dbmd.convert properties file.
