    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Text Table support for HSQLDB was originally developed by Bob
    Preston independently from the Project. Subsequently Bob joined the
    Project and incorporated this feature into version 1.7.0, with a number of
    enhancements, especially the use of conventional SQL commands for
    specifying the files used for Text Tables.</para>

    <para>In a nutshell, Text Tables are CSV or other delimited files treated
    as SQL tables. Any ordinary CSV or other delimited file can be used. The
    full range of SQL queries can be performed on these files, including
    SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. Indexes and unique constraints can be
    set up, and foreign key constraints can be used to enforce referential
    integrity between Text Tables themselves or with conventional
    tables.</para>

    <para>The delimited file can be created by the engine, or an existing file
    can be used.</para>

    <para>HyperSQL with Text Table support is the only comprehensive solution
    that employs the power of SQL and the universal reach of JDBC to handle
    data stored in text files.</para>

      <title>Definition of Tables</title>

      <para>Text Tables are defined similarly to conventional tables with the
      added TEXT keyword:</para>

      <programlisting>    CREATE TEXT TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; (&lt;column definition&gt; [&lt;constraint definition&gt;])</programlisting>

      <para>The table is at first empty and cannot be written to. An
      additional SET command specifies the file and the separator character
      that the Text table uses:</para>

      <programlisting>   SET TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; SOURCE &lt;quoted_filename_and_options&gt; [DESC]</programlisting>

          <para>Reassigning a Text Table definition to a new file has

          <para>Empty fields are treated as NULL. These are fields where there
          is nothing or just spaces between the separators.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Configuration</title>

      <para>The default field separator is a comma (,). A different field
      separator can be specified within the SET TABLE SOURCE statement. For
      example, to change the field separator for the table mytable to a
      vertical bar, place the following in the SET TABLE SOURCE statement, for
      example:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE "myfile;fs=|"</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>Since HSQLDB treats CHAR and VARCHAR strings the same, the ability
      to assign a different separator to the latter is provided. When a
      different separator is assigned to a VARCHAR, it will terminate any CSV
      field of that type. For example, if the first field is CHAR, and the
      second field VARCHAR, and the separator fs has been defined as the pipe
      (|) and vs as the period (.) then the data in the CSV file for a row
      will look like:</para>

      <screen>    First field data|Second field data.Third field data</screen>

      <para>This facility in effect offers an extra, special separator which
      can be used in addition to the global separator. The following example
      shows how to change the default separator to the pipe (|), VARCHAR
      separator to the period (.) within a SET TABLE SOURCE statement:</para>

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE "myfile;fs=|;vs=."</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      <para>HSQLDB also recognises the following special indicators for
      separators:</para>

      </variablelist>

      <para>Furthermore, HSQLDB provides csv file support with three
      additional boolean options: <varname>ignore_first</varname>,
      <varname>quoted</varname> and <varname>all_quoted</varname>. The
      <varname>ignore_first</varname> option (default false) tells HSQLDB to
      ignore the first line in a file. This option is used when the first line
      of the file contains column headings. The <varname>all_quoted</varname>
      option (default false) tells the program that it should use quotes
      around all character fields when writing to the source file. The
      <varname>quoted</varname> option (default true) uses quotes only when
      necessary to distinguish a field that contains the separator character.
      It can be set to false to prevent the use of quoting altogether and
      treat quote characters as normal characters. These options may be
      specified within the <literal>SET TABLE SOURCE</literal>
      statement:</para>

      <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE "myfile;ignore_first=true;all_quoted=true"</programlisting>

      <para>When the default options <literal>all_quoted=</literal>
      <literal>false</literal> and <literal>quoted=true</literal> are in
      force, fields that are written to a line of the csv file will be quoted
      only if they contain the separator or the quote character. The quote
      character is doubled when used inside a string. When
      <literal>all_quoted=false</literal> and <literal>quoted=false</literal>
      the quote character is not doubled. With this option, it is not possible
      to insert any string containing the separator into the table, as it
      would become impossible to distinguish from a separator. While reading
      an existing data source file, the program treats each individual field
      separately. It determines that a field is quoted only if the first
      character is the quote character. It interprets the rest of the field on
      this basis.</para>

      <para>The character encoding for the source file is<literal> ASCII
      </literal>by default. To support UNICODE or source files prepared with
      different encodings this can be changed to <literal>UTF-8</literal> or
      any other encoding. The default is <literal>encoding=ASCII </literal>and
      the option <literal>encoding=UTF-8</literal> or other supported
      encodings can be used.</para>

      <para>Finally, HSQLDB provides the ability to read a text file as READ
      ONLY, by placing the keyword "DESC" at the end of the SET TABLE SOURCE
      statement:</para>

      <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE "myfile" DESC</programlisting>

      <para>Text table source files are cached in memory. The maximum number
      of rows of data that are in memory at any time is controlled by the
      <varname>cache_rows</varname> property. The default value for
      <varname>cache_rows</varname> is 1000 and can be changed by setting the
      default database property .The <varname>cache_size</varname> property
      sets the maximum amout of memory used for each text table. The default
      is 100 KB. The properties can be set for individual text tables. These
      properties do not control the maximum size of each text table, which can
      be much larger. An example is given below:</para>

      <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE "myfile;ignore_first=true;all_quoted=true;cache_rows=10000;cache_size=1000"</programlisting>

      <para>The properties used in earlier versions, namely the
      <varname>textdb.cache_scale</varname> and the
      <varname>textdb.cache_size_scale</varname> can still be used.</para>

    <section xml:id="disconnecting_text_tables">
      <title>Disconnecting Text Tables</title>

      <para>Text tables may be <glossterm>disconnected</glossterm> from their
      underlying data source, i.e. the text file.</para>

      <para>You can explicitly disconnect a text table from its file by
      issuing the following statement: <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE OFF</programlisting></para>

      <para>Subsequently, <literal>mytable</literal> will be empty and
      read-only. However, the data source description will be preserved, and
      the table can be re-connected to it with <programlisting>    SET TABLE mytable SOURCE ON</programlisting></para>

      <para>When a database is opened, if the source file for an existing text
      table is missing the table remains disconnected from its data source,
      but the source description is preserved. This allows the missing source
      file to be added to the directory and the table re-connected to it with
      the above command.</para>

      <para>Disconnecting text tables from their source has several uses.
      While disconnected, the text source can be edited outside HSQLDB
      provided data integrity is respected. When large text sources are used,
      and several constraints or indexes need to be created on the table, it
      is possible to disconnect the source during the creation of constraints
      and indexes and reduce the time it takes to perform the
      operation.</para>

        Java system property. This feature is for security, otherwise an admin
        database user may be able to open random files. The specified text
        source path is interpreted differently according to this property. By
        default, the path is interpreted as a relative path to the directory
        path of database files, it therefore cannot contain the double dot
        notation for parent directory. This path is then appended by the
        engine to the directory path to form a full path. When the property is
        true, the path is not appended to the directory path and is used as it
        is to open the file. In this usage the path can be relative or

        is doubled. When any field containing the quote character or the

    <title>Transactions</title>

    <para>Text tables fully support transactions. New or changed rows that
    have not been committed are not updated in the source file. Therefore the
    source file always contains committed rows.</para>

    <para>However, text tables are not as resilient to machine crashes as
    other types of tables. If the crash happens while the text source is being
    written to, the text source may contain only some of the changes made
    during a committed transaction. With other types of tables, additional
    mechanisms ensure the integrity of the data and this situation will not
    arise.</para>
