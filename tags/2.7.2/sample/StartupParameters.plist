     Startup Item parameter file that works on at least one Mac OS X system.

     I don't know which of the "Uses" services are available on all Mac's.
     I just know that my system has them, and this list causes HSQLDB
     to start late enough without resorting to "Latest" (which could cause
     problems for people who also start up apps that use HSQLDB).
