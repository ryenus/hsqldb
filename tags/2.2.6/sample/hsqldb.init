# UNIX init script for HSQLDB.

# IMPORTANT!  Users running multiple HSQLDB ***Server processes*** must use a 
# unique "SERVICE" name for each Server process.  Most users will run just one 
# server instance, possibly serving lots of database instances.  Multi-server
# runners must change the value on the following line, and, if your system 
# uses chkconfig or insserv, you must change the value of "hsqldb" to the 
# same thing (as SERVICE) in the chkconfig and/or insserv blocks a few
# lines down from here (incl. in the pidfile and config file paths).  (Sorry 
# to say, but you need to repeat this procedure after every HSQLDB upgrade).
SERVICE=hsqldb
# This is the one setting which users will commonly change in this file.
# It's impossible to determine this script name (in a portable way) at boot-up 
# time, since ${0} is entirely different for init scripts, depending on UNIX 
# version.

# See the "HyperSQL on UNIX" chapter of the HyperSQL User Guide for how to
# use this file.
# This block only used by chkconfig systems (incl. SuSE Linux).
# chkconfig: 345 87 13
# description: HyperSQL Database, A High Performance Java Database Server
# pidfile: /var/run/hsqldb.pid
# config: /etc/sysconfig/hsqldb

# This block only used by insserv systems (incl. SuSE Linux).
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          hsqldb
# Required-Start:    $syslog $remote_fs $network $named
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start:     3 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 2 6
# Short-Description: HyperSQL Database Server
# Description:       HyperSQL Database, A High Performance Java Database Server
### END INIT INFO

# UNIX System-V and Linux users should copy this script to the common
# init script directory (/etc/init.d/ on most systems) with name "hsqldb",
# or whatever you have SERVICE set to (no ".init" suffix!).

# N.b.  Being a system script, this script does not use inherited variables.
# If you want to adjust a setting, edit the config file.

# Strategy of this init script is to avoid shell-specific functionality,
# and use only lowest-common-denominator Bourne capabilities.
# We don't include OS-specific functions, and we don't use shell-
# implementation-specific functionality like "echo ...\c" or "echo -n...".
# Since some Bourne shells don't support shell functions at all, we don't
# even define any local functions.

# This script has been generalized to the point that it can now "start"
# any combination of classes with the normal static main methods.
# You can supply invocation arguments to the
# TARGET_CLASS invocation, and can start as many other classes as you
# wish by using the INVOC_ADDL_ARGS setting (this includes running
# multiple HSQLDB Servers of various types).

# Template config file can be obtained from the HyperSQL distribution.
# On the day I write this, I have it located at "sample/hsqldb.cfg" in the
# distro, but that could change.  You need to copy then edit it before it
# will work.
# Recommended locations for runtime configuration file:
#   Darwin, SunOS, Solaris:  /etc/hsqldb.conf
#              (However, Sunfreeware.com builds use /usr/local/etc).
#   Linux:  /etc/sysconfig
#   FreeBSD:  /usr/local/etc/hsqldb.cfg
# (Replace the base name "hsqldb" with whatever you have SERVICE set to at
# the top of this file).
# You can put it at any of these locations and it will be used.  For
# your sanity, only put a file at one of these locations.
