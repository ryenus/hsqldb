<h3>HyperSQL version 2.2.7 Distribution</h3>
<p>HSQLDB (HyperSQL DataBase) is a relational
database engine written in Java. Version 2.2.x is the result of over 6 years
development since version 1.8.0. It offers many features and
adheres closely to the latest SQL and JDBC 4 standards.</p>
<p>This is a point release of version 2.2 which marks the 10th anniversary of our first release.
This release should be used in preference to earlier 2.x releases, as it fixes a 
number of bugs and regressions, as well as improving functionality.</p>

<h4>lib</h4>
<p>The jar needed for running HyperSQL
and its GUI utilities (hsqldb.jar) has been pre-built in this
directory. The jar is
compatible with Java version 1.6. The jar for SqlTool (sqltool.jar) is
also in this directory. The extra zip file in the directory is needed
only for
recompiling hsqldb and is not required for deployment.</p>
<h4>src</h4>
<p>All source code is in this
directory. </p>
<h4>testrun</h4>
<p>Contains test scripts for the
database engine and SqlTool. These scripts are run by separate test
utilities
for the engine and SqlTool</p>
<h4>CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Compared to version 1.8, there are many new features and changes. Most
of these do not affect existing features in version 1.8.x.</li>
<li>Differences are detailed in the Guide. The main differences
are as follows:</li>
<li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED
and SERIALIZABLE modes are supported.</li>
<li>GENERATE BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY does not create a primary
key. A primary key must be declared explicitly.</li>
<li>Column sizes are enforced, although you can change this and
other properties to some extent.</li>
</ul>
<h4>UPDATES</h4>
