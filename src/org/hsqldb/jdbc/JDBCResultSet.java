/**
 * A table of data representing a database result set, which
 * is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database.
 *
 * <P>A {@code ResultSet} object  maintains a cursor pointing
 * to its current row of data.  Initially the cursor is positioned
 * before the first row. The {@code next} method moves the
 * cursor to the next row, and because it returns {@code false}
 * when there are no more rows in the {@code ResultSet} object,
 * it can be used in a {@code while} loop to iterate through
 * the result set.
 * <P>
 * A default {@code ResultSet} object is not updatable and
 * has a cursor that moves forward only.  Thus, you can
 * iterate through it only once and only from the first row to the
 * last row. It is possible to
 * produce {@code ResultSet} objects that are scrollable and/or
 * updatable.  The following code fragment, in which {@code con}
 * is a valid {@code Connection} object, illustrates how to make
 * a result set that is scrollable and insensitive to updates by others, and
 * that is updatable. See {@code ResultSet} fields for other
 * options.
 * <PRE>
 *
 *       Statement stmt = con.createStatement(
 *                                      ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,
 *                                      ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
 *       ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT a, b FROM TABLE2");
 *       // rs will be scrollable, will not show changes made by others,
 *       // and will be updatable
 *
 * </PRE>
 * The {@code ResultSet} interface provides
 * <i>getter</i> methods ({@code getBoolean}, {@code getLong}, and so on)
 * for retrieving column values from the current row.
 * Values can be retrieved using either the index number of the
 * column or the name of the column.  In general, using the
 * column index will be more efficient.  Columns are numbered from 1.
 * For maximum portability, result set columns within each row should be
 * read in left-to-right order, and each column should be read only once.
 *
 * <P>For the getter methods, a JDBC driver attempts
 * to convert the underlying data to the Java type specified in the
 * getter method and returns a suitable Java value.  The JDBC specification
 * has a table showing the allowable mappings from SQL types to Java types
 * that can be used by the {@code ResultSet} getter methods.
 *
 * <P>Column names used as input to getter methods are case
 * insensitive.  When a getter method is called  with
 * a column name and several columns have the same name,
 * the value of the first matching column will be returned.
 * The column name option is
 * designed to be used when column names are used in the SQL
 * query that generated the result set.
 * For columns that are NOT explicitly named in the query, it
 * is best to use column numbers. If column names are used, the
 * programmer should take care to guarantee that they uniquely refer to
 * the intended columns, which can be assured with the SQL <i>AS</i> clause.
 * <P>
 * A set of updater methods were added to this interface
 * in the JDBC 2.0 API (Java 2 SDK,
 * Standard Edition, version 1.2). The comments regarding parameters
 * to the getter methods also apply to parameters to the
 * updater methods.
 * <P>
 * The updater methods may be used in two ways:
 * <ol>
 * <LI>to update a column value in the current row.  In a scrollable
 *     {@code ResultSet} object, the cursor can be moved backwards
 *     and forwards, to an absolute position, or to a position
 *     relative to the current row.
 *     The following code fragment updates the {@code NAME} column
 *     in the fifth row of the {@code ResultSet} object
 *     {@code rs} and then uses the method {@code updateRow}
 *     to update the data source table from which {@code rs} was derived.
 * <PRE>
 *
 *       rs.absolute(5); // moves the cursor to the fifth row of rs
 *       rs.updateString("NAME", "AINSWORTH"); // updates the
 *          // {@code NAME} column of row 5 to be {@code AINSWORTH}
 *       rs.updateRow(); // updates the row in the data source
 *
 * </PRE>
 * <LI>to insert column values into the insert row.  An updatable
 *     {@code ResultSet} object has a special row associated with
 *     it that serves as a staging area for building a row to be inserted.
 *     The following code fragment moves the cursor to the insert row, builds
 *     a three-column row, and inserts it into {@code rs} and into
 *     the data source table using the method {@code insertRow}.
 * <PRE>
 *
 *       rs.moveToInsertRow(); // moves cursor to the insert row
 *       rs.updateString(1, "AINSWORTH"); // updates the
 *          // first column of the insert row to be {@code AINSWORTH}
 *       rs.updateInt(2,35); // updates the second column to be {@code 35}
 *       rs.updateBoolean(3, true); // updates the third column to {@code true}
 *       rs.insertRow();
 *       rs.moveToCurrentRow();
 *
 * </PRE>
 * </ol>
 * <P>A {@code ResultSet} object is automatically closed when the
 * {@code Statement} object that
 * generated it is closed, re-executed, or used
 * to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results.
 *
 * <P>The number, types and properties of a {@code ResultSet}
 * object's columns are provided by the {@code ResultSetMetaData}
 * object returned by the {@code ResultSet.getMetaData} method.
 *
 * <!-- start release-specific documentation -->
 * <div class="ReleaseSpecificDocumentation">
 * <p class="rshead">HSQLDB-Specific Information:</p>
 *
 * A {@code ResultSet} object generated by HSQLDB is by default of
 * {@code ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY} (as is standard JDBC behavior)
 * and does not allow the use of absolute and relative positioning
 * methods.  If a statement is created with:
 *
 * <pre class="JavaCodeExample">
 * Statement stmt = conn.<b>createStatement</b>(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
 * </pre>
 *
 * then the {@code ResultSet} objects it produces support
 * using all of  the absolute and relative positioning methods of JDBC2
 * to set the position of the current row, for example:
 *
 * <pre class="JavaCodeExample">
 * rs.<b>absolute</b>(<span class="JavaNumericLiteral">5</span>);
 * String fifthRowValue = rs.<b>getString</b>(<span class="JavaNumericLiteral">1</span>);
 * rs.<b>relative</b>(<span class="JavaNumericLiteral">4</span>);
 * String ninthRowValue = rs.<b>getString</b>(<span class="JavaNumericLiteral">1</span>);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note: An HSQLDB {@code ResultSet} object stays open if it is not
 * explicitly closed, even after its
 * connection is closed.  This is regardless of the operational mode of
 * the {@link org.hsqldb.Database Database} from which it came.  That is, they
 * persist whether originating from a {@code Server},
 * {@code WebServer} or in-process mode {@code Database}. A connection
 * opened with the property setting {@code close_result=true } closes
 * any remaining open results when the connection is closed.
 * <p>
 *
 * From HSQLDB 2.0, there is full support for updatable result sets.
 * Supported methods
 * include all updateXXX methods for the supported types, as well as the
 * {@link #insertRow},
 * {@link #updateRow}, {@link #deleteRow}, {@link #moveToInsertRow}
 * methods.<p>
 *
 * The Statement must be created with ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE instead of
 * CONCUR_READ_ONLY.<p>
 *
 * Updatability of a result set follows the SQL standards. Some or all columns
 * of an updatable result set can be updated. The current row in such result sets
 * can be deleted using the {@link #deleteRow} method. Some updatable result set
 * can also be inserted into and support {@link #moveToInsertRow}.<p>
 *
 * A result set is updatable if the SELECT statement
 * is updatable. This includes SELECT from TABLE and updatable VIEW objects.
 * An updatable SELECT statement has a single underlying table or view.
 * HSQLDB supports both scrollable and forward-only result sets for updatability.
 *
 * <pre class="JavaCodeExample">
 * -- In the SELECT below, columns A and B are updatable, any row can be
 * -- deleted, but it is not insertable-into as column C is not directly from
 * -- the table.
 * SELECT A, B, A + B AS C FROM T WHERE ...
 *
 * -- The SELECT below can be insertable-into so long as other columns of the
 * -- table that do not appear in the SELECT list have a default value.
 * SELECT A, B FROM T WHERE ...

     *
     * Starting with 1.9.x, HSQLDB does an exhaustive search, backed by
     * a cache lookup (to improve performance for subsequent invocations with
     * a given input). <p>
     *
     * Upon careful investigation of the JDBC specification and the behaviour
     * of existing JDBC drivers, there is actually nothing preventing the
     * findColumn method from doing an exhaustive search, as long as it conforms
     * to the following rules (which describe the new implementation):
     *
     * <ol>
     * <li> the entire search is case insensitive
     * <li> each search iteration occurs from leftmost to rightmost column,
     *      returning the first match encountered
     * <li> the first pass matches only bare column labels
     * <li> the second pass matches only simple column names
     * <li> further passes conform to the identifier qualification
     *      and identifier quoting rules of the engine
     * </ol>
     *
     * In this implementation, the SQL tokenizer is not employed, both because
     * it does not yet correctly handle greater than two part qualification
     * and also because is is not immediately considered important to do a
     * truly exhaustive search, handling the full range of possibly mixed quoted
     * and unquoted identifier components. <p>
     *
     * Instead:
     * <ul>
     * <li> a third pass matches simple table-dot-column qualified names
     * <li> a fourth pass matches simple schema-dot-table-dot-column qualified column names
