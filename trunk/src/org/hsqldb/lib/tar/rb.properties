# IMPORTANT:  Make sure to use ISO-8859-1 encoding for any extended characters,
# both in this file (actually any .properties file) and all referenced text

# Default Locale String resources for TarGenerator.
# This file is loaded by RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle, so if any
# property here has no value set, the value MUST be set in a file
# located at targenerator/PROPERTYNAME.text

# These tell RefCapablePropertyResourceBundle to look for text files:
DbBackup.syntax
TarGenerator.syntax

# Traditional inline .properties values:
DbBackup.syntaxerr:  Syntax error.  Run the following for help:\u000a    \
    java -cp path/to/hsqldb.jar %{1}
