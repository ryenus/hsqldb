/**
 * Provides a static utility interface to an MD5 digest algorithm
 * obtained through the java.security.MessageDigest spi. <p>
 *
 * Database end-users may wish to access the services of this class
 * to provide, for instance, application user lookup tables with
 * one-way password encryption.  For example: <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * -- DDL
 * CREATE TABLE USERS(UID INTEGER IDENTITY, UNAME VARCHAR, UPASS VARCHAR, UNIQUE(UNAME))
 * CREATE FUNCTION MD5(VARCHAR(100)) RETURNS VARCHAR(16) LANGUAGE JAVA EXTERNAL NAME "org.hsqldb.lib.MD5.encode"
 *
 * -- DML & DQL
 * INSERT INTO USERS(UNAME, UPASS) VALUES('joe', MD5('passwd'))
 * UPDATE USERS SET UPASS = MD5('newpasswd') WHERE UNAME = 'joe' AND UPASS = MD5('oldpasswd')
 * SELECT UID FROM USERS WHERE UNAME = 'joe' AND UPASS = MD5('logonpasswd')
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b> <p>
 *
 * Although it is possible that a particular JVM / application installation may
 * encounter NoSuchAlgorithmException when attempting to get a jce MD5 message
 * digest generator, the likelyhood is very small for almost all JDK/JRE 1.1
 * and later  JVM implementations, as the Sun java.security package has come,
 * by default, with a jce MD5 message digest generator since JDK 1.1 was
 * released.  The HSLQLDB project could have provided an MD5 implementation to
 * guarantee presence, but this class is much more lightweight and still allows
 * clients to install / use  custom implementations through the
 * java.security.MessageDigest spi, for instance if there is no service
 * provided by default under the target JVM of choice or if a client has
 * developed / provides, say, a faster MD5 message digest implementation.
 * In short, this class is a convenience that allows HSQLDB SQL Function and
 * Stored Procedure style access to any underlying MD5 message digest algorithm
 * obtained via the java.security.MessageDigest spi
