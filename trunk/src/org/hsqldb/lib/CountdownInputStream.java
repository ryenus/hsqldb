// fredt@users - 1.9.0 corrected read(byte[], int, int)

/**
 * Counts down from a specified value the number of bytes actually read
 * from the wrapped InputStream. <p>
 *
 * Returns minus one (-1) early from readXXX methods if the count
 * down reaches zero (0) before the end of the wrapped InputStream
 * is encountered. <p>
 *
 * This class is especially useful when a fixed number of bytes is to be read
 * from an InputStream that is in turn to be used as the source for an
 * {@link java.io.InputStreamReader InputStreamReader}.
