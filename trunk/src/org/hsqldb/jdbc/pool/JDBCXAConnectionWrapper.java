/**
 * This is a wrapper class for JDBCConnection objects (not XAConnection
 * object).
 * Purpose of this class is to intercept and handle XA-related operations
 * according to chapter 12 of the JDBC 3.0 specification, by returning this
 * wrapped JDBCConnection to end-users.
 * Global transaction services and XAResources will not use this wrapper.
 * It also supports pooling, by virtue of the parent class,
 * LifeTimeConnectionWrapper.
 * <P>
 * This class name would be very precise (the class being a wrapper for
 * XA-capable JDBC Connections), except that a "XAConnection" is an entirely
 * different thing from a JDBC java.sql.Connection.
 * I can think of no way to eliminate the ambiguity without using an
 * 80-character class name.
 * Best I think I can do is to clearly state here that
 * <b>This is a wrapper for XA-capable java.sql.Connections, not for
 *    javax.sql.XAConnection.</b>

     * Connection.commit() here if end-users can execute the SQL command
