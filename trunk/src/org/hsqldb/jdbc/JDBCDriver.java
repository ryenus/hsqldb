/**
 * The interface that every driver class must implement.
 * <P>The Java SQL framework allows for multiple database drivers.
 *
 * <P>Each driver should supply a class that implements
 * the Driver interface.
  *
 * <P>The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can
 * find and then for any given connection request, it will ask each
 * driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.
 *
 * <P>It is strongly recommended that each Driver class should be
 * small and standalone so that the Driver class can be loaded and
 * queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.
 *
 * <P>When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of
 * itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means that a
 * user can load and register a driver by calling:
 * <p>
 * {@code Class.forName("foo.bah.Driver")}
 * <p>
 * A JDBC driver may create a {@linkplain DriverAction} implementation in order
 * to receive notifications when {@linkplain DriverManager#deregisterDriver} has
 * been called.
 *
 * <!-- start release-specific documentation -->
 * <div class="ReleaseSpecificDocumentation">
 * <p class="rshead">HSQLDB-Specific Information:</p>
 *
 *  When the HSQL Database Engine Driver class is loaded, it creates an
 *  instance of itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means
 *  that a user can load and register the HSQL Database Engine driver by
 *  calling:
 *  <pre>
 *  {@code Class.forName("org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver")}
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  For detailed information about how to obtain HSQLDB JDBC Connections,

 * <hr>
 *
 * <b>JDBC 4.0 notes:</b><p>
 *
 * Starting with JDBC 4.0 (JDK 1.6), the {@code DriverManager} methods
 * {@code getConnection} and {@code getDrivers} have been
 * enhanced to support the Java Standard Edition Service Provider mechanism.
 * When built under a Java runtime that supports JDBC 4.0, HSQLDB distribution
 * jars containing the Driver implementation also include the file
 * {@code META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver}. This file contains the fully
 * qualified class name ('org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCDriver') of the HSQLDB implementation
 * of {@code java.sql.Driver}. <p>
 *
 * Hence, under JDBC 4.0 or greater, applications no longer need to explicitly
 * load the HSQLDB JDBC driver using {@code Class.forName()}. Of course,
 * existing programs which do load JDBC drivers using
 * {@code Class.forName()} will continue to work without modification. <p>
 *
 * JDBC 4.2 methods added in Java 8 are generally supported.

     *
     *  For the HSQL Database Engine, at least "user" and
     *  "password" properties should be included in the Properties.<p>
     *
     *  From version 1.7.1, two optional properties are supported:
     *
     *  <ul>
     *      <li>{@code get_column_name} (default true) -  if set to false,
     *          a ResultSetMetaData.getColumnName() call will return the user
     *          defined label (getColumnLabel()) instead of the column
     *          name.<br>
     *
     *          This property is available in order to achieve
     *          compatibility with certain non-HSQLDB JDBC driver
     *          implementations.</li>
     *
     *      <li>{@code strict_md} if set to true, some ResultSetMetaData
     *          methods return more strict values for compatibility
     *          reasons.</li>
     *  </ul> <p>
     *
     *  From version 1.8.0.x, {@code strict_md} is deprecated (ignored)
     *  because metadata reporting is always strict (JDBC-compliant), and
     *  three new optional properties are supported:
     *
     *  <ul>
     *      <li>{@code ifexits} (default false) - when true, an exception
     *          is raised when attempting to connect to an in-process
     *          file: or mem: scheme database instance if it has not yet been
     *          created.  When false, an in-process file: or mem: scheme
     *          database instance is created automatically if it has not yet
     *          been created. This property does not apply to requests for
     *          network or res: (i.e. files_in_jar) scheme connections. <li>
     *
     *      <li>{@code shutdown} (default false) - when true, the
     *          the target database mimics the behaviour of 1.7.1 and older
     *          versions. When the last connection to a database is closed,
     *          the database is automatically shut down. The property takes
     *          effect only when the first connection is made to the database.
     *          This means the connection that opens the database. It has no
     *          effect if used with subsequent, simultaneous connections. <br>
     *
     *          This command has two uses. One is for test suites, where
     *          connections to the database are made from one JVM context,
     *          immediately followed by another context. The other use is for
     *          applications where it is not easy to configure the environment
     *          to shutdown the database. Examples reported by users include
     *          web application servers, where the closing of the last
     *          connection coincides with the web application being shut down.
     *          </li>
     *
     *      <li>{@code default_schema} - backwards compatibility feature.
     *          To be used for clients written before HSQLDB schema support.
     *          Denotes whether to use the default schema when a schema
     *          qualifier is not included in a database object's SQL identifier
     *          character sequence. Also affects the semantics of
     *          DatabaseMetaData calls that supply null-valued schemaNamePattern
     *          parameter values.</li>
