    :s/from/to/[igm;] One or multiple Substitutions with specified options
                from:  Standard regexp.  See 'perlre' man page or
                       Java API spec for java.util.regex.Pattern.
                to:    If empty, from's will be deleted (e.g. ":s/x//").
                [igm;] Options work exactly as in Perl or java.util.regex,
                       except ';' means to execute after substitution,
                       'g' means Global (multiple) substitutions,
                       and option 's' is always on.
                /:     Can actually be any character which occurs in

                       i:  case Insensitive
                       g:  Global (substitute ALL occurrences of "from" string)
                       m:  ^ and $ match line breaks (like Perl m option)
                       ;:  execute immediately after substitution
