                anybody has attempted to run HSQLDB with TLS under IBM's Java, 
                and I'm sure that nobody in the HSQLDB Development Group has

                If you are running the server side, then you'll need to run a

                It doesn't matter if the underlying database instances are
                new, and it doesn't matter if you are making a new Server 
                configuration or encrypting an existing Server configuration.
                (You can turn encryption on and off at will).

                You need a HSQLDB jar file that was built with JSSE present.

                all set, because we build with Java 1.4 (which contains JSSE).
                If you build your own jar file with Java 1.3, make sure to

                At this time, the latter will only work for clients running 
                with Java 1.4.
            </para> <para>
                If the server you wish to connect to is using a certificate 
                approved by your default trust keystores, then there is nothing 
                else to do.
                If not, then you need to tell Java to "trust" the server cert.
                (It's a slight over-simplification to say that if the server
                certificate was purchased, then you are all set;
                if somebody "signed their own" certificate by self-signing or
                using a private ca certificate, then you need to set up trust).
            </para> <para>
                First, you need to obtain the cert (only the "public" part of 
                it).
                Since this cert is passed to all clients, you could obtain it 
                by writing a java client that dumps it to file, or perhaps by 
                using <emphasis>openssl s_client</emphasis>.
                Since in most cases, if you want to trust a non-commercial 
                cert, you probably have access to the server keystore, I'll 
                show an example of how to get what you need from the 
                server-side JKS keystore.
            </para>
                <para>
                    You may already have an X509 cert for your server.
                    If you have a server keystore, then you can generate a
                    X509 cert like this.
                <example>
                <title>Exporting certificate from the server's keystore</title>
                <screen>
    keytool -export -keystore server.store -alias existing_alias -file server.cer</screen>
                </example>
                In this example, <filename>server.cer</filename> is the X509
                certificate that you need for the next step.
                </para><para>
                Now, you need to add this cert to one of the system trust 
                keystores or to a keystore of your own.
                See <ulink url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CustomizingStores">
                the Customizing Stores section in JSSERefGuide.html</ulink> to 
                see where your system trust keystores are.
                You can put private keystores anywhere you want to.
                The following command will add the cert to an existing 
                keystore, or create a new keystore if 
                <filename>client.store</filename> doesn't exist.
            </para><example>
                <title>Adding a certificate to the client keystore</title>
                <screen>
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore trust.store -alias new_alias -file server.cer</screen>
            </example>
            <para>
                If you are making a new keystore, you probably want to start
                with a copy of your system default keystore which you can
                find somewhere under your JAVA_HOME directory (typically
                jre/lib/security/cacerts for a JDK, but I forget exactly
                where it is for a JRE).
            </para> <para>
                Unless your OS can't stop other people from writing to your 
                files, you probably do not want to set a password on the trust 
                keystore.
            </para> <para>
                If you added the cert to a system trust store, then you are 
                finished.
                Otherwise you will need to specify your custom trust keystore
                to your client program.
                The generic way to set the trust keystore is to set the sytem 
                property
                <classname>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</classname> every time that 
                you run your client program.
                For example
                <example>
                <title>Specifying your own trust store to a JDBC client</title>
                    <screen>
    java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/blaine/trust.store -jar /path/to/hsqldb.jar dest-urlid</screen>
                </example>
                This example runs the program
                <link linkend='unix-chapter'>SqlTool</link>.
                SqlTool has built-in TLS support, however, so, for SqlTool
                you can set <literal>truststore</literal> on a per-urlid
                basis in the SqlTool configuration file.
            </para>
            <para>
                N.b.  The hostname in your database URL must match the 
                <emphasis>Common Name</emphasis> of the server's certificate 
                exactly.
                That means that if a site certificate is 
                <literal>admc.com</literal>, you can not use
                <literal>jdbc:hsqldb:hsqls://localhost</literal> or
                <literal>jdbc:hsqldb:hsqls://www.admc.com:1100</literal> to 
                connect to it.

                Then set the system property javax.net.ssl.keyStore to the path 
                to that file, and
                <classname>javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword</classname> to the 
                password of the keystore (and to the private key-- they have

            There are two main ways to do this.
            Either you can use a certificate signed by a certificate authority,
            or you can make your own.
            One thing that you need to know in both cases is, the
