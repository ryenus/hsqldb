<!-- Load a named resource.  Where these are loaded from may be dynamically
     overridden with "catalogs".
     Since these entities are needed both for validation and for XSLT
     transformation, we must specify the overriding value both in our catalog
     file and in the xmlcatalog element in build.xml.
     The example here is rather useful, because this pulls in the standard
     DocBook character entities, and allows to dynamically pull the entities
     from a http server or a local DocBook installation, for example.
