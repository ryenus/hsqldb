    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>This chapter is about access control to database objects such as
    tables, inside the database engine. Other issues related to security
    include user authentication, password complexity and secure connections
    are covered in the <link endterm="management-title" xlink:arcrole=""
    xlink:href="#management-chapt"></link> chapter and the <link
    endterm="listeners-title" xlink:href="#listeners-chapt"></link>
    chapter.</para>

    <para>Apart from schemas and their object, each HyperSQL catalog has USER
    and ROLE objects. These objects are collectively called
    <emphasis>authorizations</emphasis>. Each AUTHORIZATION has some access
    rights on some of the schemas or the objects they contain. The persistent
    elements of an SQL environment are database objects</para>

    <para>Authorizations names are stored in the database in the case-normal
    form. When connecting to a database via JDBC, the user name and password
    must match the case of this case-normal form.</para>

    <para>When a user is created with the CREATE USER statement, if the user
    name is enclosed in double quotes, the exact name is used as the
    case-normal form. But if it is not enclosed in double quotes, the name is
    converted to uppercase and this uppercase version is stored in the
    database as the case-normal form.</para>

  <section xml:id="acc_auth_and_access_ctrl">
    <title>Authorizations and Access Control</title>

    <para>In general, ROLE and USER objects simply control access to schema
    objects. This is the scope of the SQL Standard. However, there are special
    roles that allow the creation of USER and ROLE objects and also allow some
    special operations on the database as a whole. These roles are not defined
    by the Standard, which has left it to implementers to define such roles as
    they are needed for the particular SQL implementation.</para>

    <para>A ROLE has a name a collection of zero or more other roles, plus
    some privileges (access rights). A USER has a name and a password. It
    similarly has a collection of zero or more roles plus some
    privileges.</para>

    <para>USER objects existed in the SQL-92, but ROLE objects were introduced
    in SQL:1999. Originally it was intended that USER objects would normally
    be the same as the operating system USER objects and their authentication
    would be handled outside the SQL environment. The co-existence of ROLE and
    USER objects results in complexity. With the addition of ROLE objects,
    there is no rationale, other than legacy support, for granting privileges
    to USER objects directly. It is better to create roles and grant
    privileges to them, then grant the roles to USER objects.</para>

    <para>The Standard effectively defines a special ROLE, named PUBLIC. All
    authorization have the PUBLIC role, which cannot be removed from them.
    Therefore any access right assigned to the PUBLIC role applies to all
    authorizations in the database. For many simple databases, it is adequate
    to create a single, non-admin user, then assign access rights to the
    pre-existing PUBLIC role. Access to INFORMATION_SCHEMA views is granted to
    PUBLIC, therefore these views are accessible to all. However, the contents
    of each view depends on the ROLE or USER (AUTHORIZATION) that is in force
    while accessing the view.</para>

    <para>Each schema has a single AUTHORIZATION. This is commonly known as
    the <emphasis>owner</emphasis> of the schema. All the objects in the
    schema inherit the schema owner. The schema owner can add objects to the
    schema, drop them or alter them.</para>

    <para>By default, the objects in a schema can only be accessed by the
    schema owner. The schema owner can grant access rights on the objects to
    other users or roles.</para>

    <section xml:id="acc_built_in_roles_users">
      <title>Built-In Roles and Users</title>

      <para>There are some pre-defined roles in each database; some defined by
      the SQL Standard, some by HyperSQL. These roles can be assigned to users
      (directly or via other, user-defined roles). In addition, there is the
      initial SYS user created with each new database. The initial user name
      and password is defined in the connection properties when the first
      connection to the database is made. In older versions of HSQLDB, this
      name was always SA. But in the latest version, the name can be defined
      as a different string.</para>

      <simpara><emphasis>the PUBLIC role</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>The role that is assigned to all authorizations (roles and
      users) in the database. This role has access rights to all objects in
      the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. Any roles or rights granted to this role, are in
      effect granted to all users of the database.</simpara>

      <simpara>This role is the authorization for the pre-defined (system)

      </indexterm>

      <simpara><emphasis role="bold">DBA</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis>the DBA role (HyperSQL-specific)</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>This is a special role in HyperSQL. A user that has this role
      can perform all possible administrative tasks on the database. The DBA
      role can also act as a proxy for all the roles and users in the
      database. This means it can do everything the authorization for a schema
      can do, including dropping the schema or its objects, or granting rights
      on the schema objects to a grantee.</simpara>

      (HyperSQL-specific)</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>An authorization that has this role, can create schemas. The
      DBA authorization has this role and can grant it to other
      authorizations.</simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis role="bold">CHANGE_AUTHORIZATION</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis>the CHANGE_AUTHORIZATION role
      (HyperSQL-specific)</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>A user that has this role, can change the authorization for the
      current session to another user. The other user cannot have the DBA role
      (otherwise, the original user would gain DBA privileges). The DBA
      authorization has this role and can grant it to other
      authorizations.</simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis>the SYS user (HyperSQL-specific)</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>This user is automatically created with a new database and has
      the DBA role. This user name and its password are defined in the
      connection properties when connecting to the new database to create the
      database. As this user, it is possible to change the password, create
      other users and created new schema objects. The initial SYS user can be
      dropped by another user that has the DBA role. As a result, there is
      always at least one SYS user in the database.</simpara>

    <section xml:id="acc_listing">
      <title>Listing Users and Roles</title>

      <para>Tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA contain the list of users and
      roles for the database.</para>

      <para>The SYSTEM_USERS tables contains the list of users, with some
      extra settings for each user. The AUTHORIZATIONS table contains a list
      of both users and roles.</para>

      <para>Several other INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables list the privileges
      granted to users and roles on different database objects. Refer to the
      <link endterm="databaseobjects-title"
      xlink:href="#databaseobjects-chapt"></link> chapter for a list and
      description of the tables. Example below:</para>

      <para><informalexample>
          <programlisting> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_USERS 
 SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_PRIVILEGES
</programlisting>
        </informalexample></para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="acc_access_rights">
      <title>Access Rights</title>

      <para>By default, the objects in a schema can only be accessed by the
      schema owner. But the schema owner can grant privileges (access rights)
      on the objects to other users or roles.</para>

      <para>Things can get far more complex, because the grant of privileges
      can be made WITH GRANT OPTION. In this case, the role or user that has
      been granted the privilege can grant the privilege to other roles and
      users.</para>

      <para>Privileges can also be revoked from users or roles.</para>

      <para>The statements for granting and revoking privileges normally
      specify which privileges are granted or revoked. However, there is a
      shortcut, ALL PRIVILEGES, which means all the privileges that the
      <literal>&lt;grantor&gt;</literal> has on the schema object. The
      <literal>&lt;grantor&gt;</literal> is normally the CURRENT_USER of the
      session that issues the statement.</para>

      <para>The user or role that is granted privileges is referred to as
      <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> for the granted privileges.</para>

      <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Table</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>For tables, including views, privileges can be granted with
      different degrees of granularity. It is possible to grant a privilege on
      all columns of a table, or on specific columns of the table.</simpara>

      <simpara>The DELETE privilege applies to the table, rather than its
      columns. It applies to all DELETE statements.</simpara>

      <simpara>The SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE privileges may apply to all
      columns or to individual columns. These privileges determine whether the
      <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> can execute SQL data statements on
      the table.</simpara>

      <simpara>The SELECT privilege designates the columns that can be
      referenced in SELECT statements, as well as the columns that are read in
      a DELETE or UPDATE statement, including the search condition.</simpara>

      <simpara>The INSERT privilege designates the columns into which explicit
      values can be inserted. To be able to insert a row into the table, the
      user must therefore have the INSERT privilege on the table, or at least
      all the columns that do not have a default value.</simpara>

      <simpara>The UPDATE privilege simply designates the table or the
      specific columns that can be updated.</simpara>

      <simpara>The REFERENCES privilege allows the
      <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> to define a FOREIGN KEY constraint on
      a different table, which references the table or the specific columns
      designated for the REFERENCES privilege.</simpara>

      <simpara>The TRIGGER privilege allows adding a trigger to the
      table.</simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Sequence, Type, Domain, Character Set,
      Collation, Transliteration,</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>For these objects, only USAGE can be granted. The USAGE
      privilege is needed when object is referenced directly in an SQL
      statement.</simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Routine</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>For routines, including procedures or functions, only EXECUTE
      privilege can be granted. This privilege is needed when the routine is
      used directly in an SQL statement.</simpara>

      <simpara><emphasis role="bold">Other Objects</emphasis></simpara>

      <simpara>Other objects such as constraints and assertions are not used
      directly and there is no grantable privilege that refers to
      them.</simpara>

    <simpara><literal>&lt;privilege column list&gt; ::= &lt;column name
    list&gt;</literal></simpara>

    <simpara><literal>&lt;grantee&gt; ::= PUBLIC | &lt;authorization
    identifier&gt;</literal></simpara>

    <simpara>The <literal>&lt;object privileges&gt;</literal> that can be used
    depend on the type of the <literal>&lt;object name&gt;</literal>. These
    are discussed in the previous section. For a table, if
    <literal>&lt;privilege column list&gt;</literal> is not specified, then
    the privilege is granted on the table, which includes all of its columns
    and any column that may be added to it in the future. For routines, the
    name of the routine can be specified in two ways, either as the generic
    name as the specific name. HyperSQL allows referencing all overloaded
    versions of a routine at the same time, using its name. This differs from
    the SQL Standard which requires the use of <literal>&lt;specific routine
    designator&gt;</literal> to grant privileges separately on each different
    signature of the routine.</simpara>

    <simpara>Each <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> is the name of a role or
    a user. Examples of GRANT statement are given below:</simpara>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting> GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCE aSequence TO roleOrUser 
 GRANT SELECT ON aTable TO roleOrUser  
 GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON aTABLE TO roleOrUser1, roleOrUser2
 GRANT SELECT(columnA, columnB), UPDATE(columnA, columnB) ON TABLE aTable TO roleOrUser
 GRANT EXECUTE ON SPECIFIC ROUTINE aroutine_1234 TO rolOrUser
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <simpara>As mentioned in the general discussion, it is better to define a
    role for the collection of all the privileges required by an application.
    This role is then granted to any user. If further changes are made to the
    privileges of this role, they are automatically reflected in all the users
    that have the role.</simpara>

    <simpara><emphasis role="bold">GRANT</emphasis></simpara>

    <simpara><emphasis>grant role statement</emphasis></simpara>

    <simpara><literal>&lt;grant role statement&gt; ::= GRANT &lt;role name&gt;
    [ { &lt;comma&gt; &lt;role name&gt; }... ] TO &lt;grantee&gt; [ {
    &lt;comma&gt; &lt;grantee&gt; }... ] [ WITH ADMIN OPTION ] [ GRANTED BY
    &lt;grantor&gt; ]</literal></simpara>

    <simpara>Assign roles to roles or users. One or more roles can be assigned
    to one or more <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> objects. A
    <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> is a user or a role. If the <literal>[
    WITH ADMIN OPTION ]</literal> is specified, then each
    <literal>&lt;grantee&gt;</literal> can grant the newly assigned roles to
    other grantees. An example of user and role creation with grants is given
    below:</simpara>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting> CREATE USER appuser
 CREATE ROLE approle
 GRANT approle TO appuser
 GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON TABLE atable TO approle
 GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE asequence to approle
 GRANT EXECUTE ON ROUTINE aroutine TO approle
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <simpara><emphasis role="bold">REVOKE privilege</emphasis></simpara>

    <simpara><literal>&lt;revoke privilege statement&gt; ::= REVOKE [ GRANT

    FROM &lt;grantee&gt; [ { &lt;comma&gt; &lt;grantee&gt; }... ] [ GRANTED BY
    &lt;grantor&gt; ] RESTRICT | CASCADE</literal></simpara>

    <simpara><literal>&lt;role revoked&gt; ::= &lt;role

    <simpara>Revoke a role from users or roles.</simpara>
