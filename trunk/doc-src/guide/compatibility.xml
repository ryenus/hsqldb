    <title>Compatibility Overview</title>

    <para>HyperSQL is used more than any other database engine for application
    testing and development targeted at other databases. Over the years, this
    usage resulted in developers finding and reporting many obscure bugs and
    opportunities for enhancements in HyperSQL. The bugs have all been fixed
    shortly after the report and enhancements were added in later
    versions.</para>

    <para>HyperSQL 2.x has been written to the SQL Standard and avoids the
    traps caused by superficial imitation of the Standard by some other RDBMS.
    The SQL Standard has existed since 1989 and has been expanded over the
    years in several revisions. HyperSQL follows SQL:2011. Also, the X-Open
    specification has defined a number of SQL functions which are implemented
    by most RDBMS.</para>

    <para>HyperSQL has many property settings that relax conformance to the
    Standard in order to allow compatibility with other RDBMS, without
    breaking the core integrity of the database. These properties are modified
    with SET DATABASE SQL statements described in the SQL Conformance Settings
    section of Management chapter.</para>

    <para>HyperSQL is very flexible and provides some other properties which
    define a preference among various valid choices. For example the ability
    to set the transaction model of the database, or the ability to define the
    scale of the data type of the result of integer division or average
    calculation (<literal>SET DATABASE SQL AVG SCALE</literal>).</para>

    <para>Each major RDBMS supports additional functions that are not covered
    by the standard. Some RDBMS use non-standard syntax for some operations.
    Fortunately, most popular RDBMS products have introduced better
    compatibility with the Standard in their recent versions, but there are
    still some portability issues. HyperSQL overcomes the potability issues
    using these strategies</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>An extensive set of functions cover the SQL Standard, X-Open,
        and most of the useful functions that other RDBMS support.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Database properties, which can be specified on the URL or as SQL
        statements, relax conformance to the Standard in order to allow
        non-standard comparisons and assignments allowed by other
        RDBMS.</para>

      <title>MySQL Compatibility</title>

      <para>The latest versions of MySQL have introduced better Standard
      compatibility but some of these features have to be turned on via
      properties. You should therefore check the current Standard
      compatibility settings of your MySQL database and use the available
      HyperSQL properties to achieve closer results. If you avoid the few
      anti-Standard features of MySQL, you can port your databases to
      HyperSQL.</para>

      <para>Using HyperSQL during development and testing of MySQL apps helps
      to avoid data integrity issues that MySQL may ignore.</para>

      <para>HyperSQL does not have the following non-standard limitations of
      MySQL.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>With HyperSQL, an UPDATE statement can update UNIQUE and
          PRIMARY KEY columns of a table without causing an exception due to
          temporary violation of constraints. These constraints are checked at
          the end of execution, therefore there is no need for an ORDER BY
          clause in an UPDATE statement.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>MySQL foreign key constraints are not enforced by the default
          MyISAM engine. Be aware of the possibility of data being rejected by
          HyperSQL due to these constraints.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>With HyperSQL INSERT or UPDATE statements either succeed or
          fail due to constraint violation. MySQL has the non-standard IGNORE
          override to ignore violations and alter the data, which is not
          accepted by HyperSQL.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Unlike MySQL, HyperSQL allows you to modify a table with an
          INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement which selects from the same table
          in a subquery.</para>
        </listitem>

      <para>Follow the guidelines below for converting MySQL databases and
      applications.</para>

          <para>Use <literal>SET DATABASE SQL SYNTAX MYS TRUE</literal> or the
          equivalent URL property <literal>sql.syntax_mys=true</literal> to
          enable support for AUTO_INCREMENT and TEXT data types and several
          other types. These type definitions are translated into HyperSQL
          equivalents.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Use MVCC with <literal>SET DATABASE TRANSACTION CONTROL
          MVCC</literal> if your application is multi-user.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Avoid storing invalid values, for example invalid dates such
          as '0000-00-00' or '2001-00-00' which are rejected by
          HyperSQL.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Avoid the MySQL feature that trims spaces at the end of CHAR
          values.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In MySQL, a database is the same as a schema. In HyperSQL
          several schemas can exist in the same database and accessed
          transparently. In addition a HyperSQL server supports multiple
          separate databases.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>In MySQL, older, non-standard, forms of database object name
          case-sensitivity make is difficult to port applications. Use the
          latest form which encloses case-sensitive names in double
          quotes.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you use concatenation of possibly NULL values in your

        <listitem>
          <para>If your application relies on MySQL behaviour for ordering of

          <para>MySQL supports most SQL Standard types (except INTERVAL
          types), as well as non-standard types, which are also supported by
          HyperSQL. Supported types include SMALLINT, INT, BIGINT, DOUBLE,
          FLOAT, DECIMAL, NUMERIC, VARCHAR, CHAR, BINARY, VARBINARY, BLOB,
          DATE, TIMESTAMP (all Standard SQL) and TINYINT, DATETIME (non
          Standard). UNSIGNED types are converted to signed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>MySQL uses a non-standard expression, <literal>SELECT 'A Test
          String'</literal> to return a single row table. The standard form is
          <literal>VALUES('A Test String')</literal>. In MYS syntax mode, this
          type of SELECT is supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Indexes defined inside CREATE TABLE statements are accepted
          and created. The index names must be unique within the
          schema.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>HyperSQL supports ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for column
          definitions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>HyperSQL translates INSERT IGNORE, REPLACE and ON DUPLICATE
          KEY UPDATE variations of INSERT into predictable and error-free
          operations.</para>

          <para>When INSERT IGNORE is used, if any of the inserted rows would
          violate a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint, that row is not
          inserted. The rest of the rows are then inserted only if there is no
          other violation such as long strings or type mismatch, otherwise the
          appropriate error is returned.</para>

          <para>When REPLACE or ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE is used, the rows that
          need replacing or updating are updated with the given values. This
          works exactly like an UPDATE statement for those rows. Referential
          constraints and other integrity checks are enforced and update
          triggers are activated. The row count returned is simply the total
          number of rows inserted and updated.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>MySQL user-defined function and procedure syntax is very
