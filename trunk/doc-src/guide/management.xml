    <title>Mode of Operation and Tables</title>

    <para>HyperSQL has many modes of operation and features that allow it to
    be used in very different scenarios. Levels of memory usage, speed and
    accessibility by different applications are influenced by how HyperSQL is
    deployed.</para>

      <title>Database Types</title>

      <para>There are three types of database, <literal>mem:</literal>,
      <literal>file:</literal> and <literal>res:</literal>. The mem: type is
      stored all in memory and not persisted to file. The
      <literal>file:</literal> type is persisted to file. The
      <literal>res:</literal> type is also based on files, but the files are
      loaded from the classpath, similar to resource and class files. Changes
      to the data in <literal>file:</literal> databases are persisted, unless
      the database is <literal>readonly</literal>, or
      <literal>files_readonly</literal> (using optional property settings).
      Changes to <literal>res:</literal> databases are not persisted.</para>

      <section xml:id="mtc_readonly_database">
        <title>Readonly Databases</title>

        <para>A <glossterm>file:</glossterm> catalog can be made readonly
        permanently, or it can be opened as readonly. To make the database
        readonly, the property, value pair, <literal>readonly=true</literal>
        can be added to the <filename>.properties</filename> file of the
        database. The SHUTDOWN command must be used to close the database
        before making this change.</para>

        <para>It is also possible to open a normal database as readonly. For
        this, the property can be included in the URL of the first connection
        to the database.</para>

        <para>With readonly databases, it is still possible to insert and
        delete rows in TEMP tables.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>RES and Files Readonly Databases</title>

        <para>There is another option which allows MEMORY tables to be
        writeable, but without persisting the changes at SHUTDOWN. This option
        is activated with the property, value pair,
        <literal>files_readonly=true</literal>, which can be added to the
        <filename>.properties</filename> file of the database, or included in
        the URL of the first connection to the database.</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>res:</glossterm> catalog, is a set of database
        files on the classpath (inside a jar or alongside class files). The
        database is opened with a URL in the form of
        <literal>jdbc:hsqldb:res:&lt;database path&gt;</literal>. These
        databases are always <literal>files_readonly</literal> and have the
        same restrictions as <literal>files_readonly</literal>
        <glossterm>file:</glossterm> catalogs.</para>

        <para>CACHED tables and LOBS in these catalogs are readonly. It is not
        possible to create new LOBs in these catalogs, but you can use
        existing LOBs in new rows.</para>

        <para>These options are useful for running application tests which
        operate on a predefined dataset.</para>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="mtc_table_types">
      <title>Tables</title>

      <para>TEXT tables are designed for special applications where the data
      has to be in an interchangeable format, such as CSV (comma separated
      values). TEXT tables should not be used for routine storage of data that
      changes a lot.</para>

      <para>MEMORY tables and CACHED tables are generally used for data
      storage. The difference between the two is as follows:</para>

      <para><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The data for all MEMORY tables is read from the *.script
            file when the database is started and stored in memory. In
            contrast the data for cached tables is not read into memory until
            the table is accessed. Furthermore, only part of the data for each
            CACHED table is held in memory, allowing tables with more data
            than can be held in memory.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When the database is shutdown in the normal way, all the
            data for MEMORY tables is written out to the disk. In comparison,
            the data in CACHED tables that has changed is written out during
            operation and at shutdown.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The size and capacity of the data cache for all the CACHED
            tables is configurable. This makes it possible to allow all the
            data in CACHED tables to be cached in memory. In this case, speed
            of access is good, but slightly slower than MEMORY tables.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>For normal applications it is recommended that MEMORY tables
            are used for small amounts of data, leaving CACHED tables for
            large data sets. For special applications in which speed is
            paramount and a large amount of free memory is available, MEMORY
            tables can be used for large tables as well.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>You can change the type of the table with the <literal>SET
            TABLE &lt;table name&gt; TYPE { CACHED | MEMORY
            }</literal>statement.</para>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="mtc_large_objects">
      <title>Large Objects</title>

      <para>HyperSQL 2.0 supports dedicated storage and access to BLOB and
      CLOB objects. These objects can have huge sizes. BLOB or CLOB is
      specified as the type of a column of the table. Afterwards, rows can be
      inserted into the table using a PreparedStatement for efficient transfer
      of large LOB data to the database. In <glossterm>mem:</glossterm>
      catalogs, CLOB and BLOB data is stored in memory. In
      <glossterm>file:</glossterm> catalogs, this data is stored in a single
      separate file which has the extension *.lobs. The size of this file can
      grow to huge, terabyte figures. By default, a minimum 32 KB is allocated
      to each LOB. You can reduced this if your LOBs are generally
      smaller.</para>

      <para>LOB data should be stored in the database using a JDBC
      PreparedStatement object. The streaming methods send the LOB to the
      database in one operation as a binary or character stream. Inside the
      database, the disk space is allocated as needed and the data is saved as
      it is being received. LOB data should be retrieved from the database
      using a JDBC ResultSet method. When a streaming method is used to
      retrieve a LOB, it is retrieved in large chunks in a transparent manner.
      LOB data can also be retrieved as String or byte[], but these methods
      use more memory and may not be practical for large objects.</para>

      <para>LOB data is not duplicated in the database when a lob is copied
      from one table to another. The disk space is reused when a LOB is
      deleted and is no longer contained in any table. This happens only at
      the time of a CHECKPOINT.</para>

      <para>By using a dedicated LOB store, HyperSQL achieves consistently
      high speeds (usually over 20MB / s) for both storage and retrieval of
      LOBs.</para>

      <para>There is an internal LOBS schema in the database to store the
      id's, sizes and addresses of the LOBs (but not the actual LOBS) in a few
      system tables. This schema is stored in the database as MEMORY tables.
      Therefore the amount of JVM memory should be increased when more than
      tens of thousands of LOBs are stored in the database. If your database
      contains more than a few hundreds of thousands of LOBs and memory use
      becomes an issue, you can change one or all LOB schema tables to CACHED
      tables. See statements below:</para>

      <example>
        <title>Using CACHED tables for the LOB schema</title>

        <screen> SET TABLE SYSTEM_LOBS.BLOCKS TYPE CACHED
 SET TABLE SYSTEM_LOBS.LOBS TYPE CACHED
 SET TABLE SYSTEM_LOBS.PARTS TYPE CACHED
 SET TABLE SYSTEM_LOBS.LOB_IDS TYPE CACHED
</screen>

    <section xml:id="mtc_deploy_context">
      <title>Deployment context</title>

      <para>The files used for storing HyperSQL database data are all in the
      same directory. New files are always created and deleted by the database
      engine. Two simple principles must be observed:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Java process running HyperSQL must have full privileges on
          the directory where the files are stored. This include create and
          delete privileges.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The file system must have enough spare room both for the
          'permanent' and 'temporary' files. The default maximum size of the
          *.log file is 50MB. The *.data file can grow to up to 64GB (more if
          the default has been increased). The .backup file can be up to the
          size of the *.data file. The *.lobs file can grow to several
          terabytes. The temporary files created at the time of a SHUTDOWN can
          be equal in size to the *.script file and the .data file.</para>

          <para>In desktop deployments, virus checker programs may interfere

  <section xml:id="mtc_acid_persistence">
    <title>ACID, Persistence and Reliability</title>

    <para>HyperSQL 2.0 uses the persistence mechanism used in version 1.8,
    with important enhancements. The code has proven reliable, as the last
    critical issue was fixed 2 years before the release of version 2.0.</para>

    <para>There are further enhancements in version 2.3.3</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>The NIO file access implementation has been improved</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Persistence relies on the JVM, the operating system, and the
    computer hardware. A database system like HSQLDB can perform millions of
    read and write operations in an hour. As system hardware and software can
    go wrong, it is impossible to achieve zero failure rate. Therefore regular
    backups are recommended. HyperSQL 2.3 has built-in database backup and
    restore features, discussed elsewhere in this chapter.</para>

    <para>A note regarding the NIO file access implementation: This
    implementation applies only to CACHED table data in the
    <literal>.data</literal> file. Other files are not accessed via NIO. There
    has been an issue with some JVM implementations of nio not releasing the
    file buffers after they were closed. HyperSQL uses a workaround which is
    recommended for Sun JVM's. This does not apply to other JVM's. In such
    environments, it is therefore recommended to test the CHECKPOINT DEFRAG
    operation and the shutting down and restarting the database inside the
    same Java process extensively with NIO. Use of NIO can be turned off if
    necessary.</para>

    <section xml:id="mtc_acid">
      <title>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</title>

      <para>Atomicity means a transaction either fails without changing the
      data, or succeeds. HyperSQL ensures atomicity both during operations and
      in the event of a system crash.</para>

      <para>Consistency means all the implicit and explicit integrity
      constraints are always enforced. HyperSQL always enforces the
      constraints and at the same time does not allow unenforceable
      constraints (illegal forms of CHECK constraints) to be created.</para>

      <para>Isolation means transactions do not interfere with each other.
      HyperSQL enforces isolation according to strict rules of the database
      isolation model (MVCC or LOCKS).</para>

      <para>Durability means a committed transaction is protected in case of a
      system crash. HyperSQL ensures durability according to the setting for
      WRITE DELAY MILLIS. A zero delay setting results in an
      FileDescriptor#sync() call each time a transaction commits. A timed
      delay means the FileDescriptor#sync() call is executed in the given
      intervals and only the last transactions committed in the time interval
      may be lost. The default time interval is 0.5 second. The sync() call is
      also made at all critical points, including when a file is about to be
      closed. Durability of files requires a reliable JVM and disk storage
      system that stores the data safely with a sync() call. In practice, many
      systems are generally reliable in this respect.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>System Operations</title>

      <para>A database is opened when the first connection is successfully
      made. It remains open until the <literal>SHUTDOWN</literal> command is
      issued. If the connection property shutdown=true is used for the first
      connection to the database, the database is shutdown when the last
      connection is closed. Otherwise the database remains open and will
      accept the next connection attempt.</para>

      <para>The <literal>SHUTDOWN</literal> command shuts down the database
      properly and allows the database to be reopened quickly. This command
      may take some seconds as it saves all the modified data in the
      .<literal>script</literal> and <literal>.data</literal> files. Variants
      of <literal>SHUTDOWN</literal> such as <literal>SHUTDOWN
      COMPACT</literal> and <literal>SHUTDOWN SCRIPT</literal> can be used
      from time to time to reduce the overall size of the database files.
      Another variant is <literal>SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY</literal> which ensures
      all changes to data are stored in the <literal>.log</literal> file but
      does not save the changes in .<literal>script</literal> and
      <literal>.data</literal> files. The shutdown is performed quickly but
      the database will take much longer to reopen.</para>

      <para>During the lifetime of the database the checkpoint operation may
      be performed from time to time. The <literal>SET FILES LOG SIZE &lt;
      value &gt;</literal> setting and its equivalent URL property determine
      the frequency of automatic checkpoints. An online backup also performs a
      checkpoint when the backup is not a hot backup. A checkpoint can be
      performed by the user at any time using the
      <literal>CHECKPOINT</literal> statement. The main purpose of checkpoints
      is to reduce the total size of database files and to allow a quick
      restart in case the database is closed without a proper shutdown. The
      <literal>CHECKPOINT DEFRAG</literal> variant compacts the
      <literal>.data</literal> file in a similar but way as <literal>SHUTDOWN
      COMPACT</literal> does. Obviously this variant takes much longer than a
      normal <literal>CHECKPOINT</literal>. A database setting allows a
      <literal>CHECKPOINT DEFRAG</literal> to be performed automatically when
      wasted space in the <literal>.data</literal> file exceeds the specified
      percentage.</para>

      <para>In a multi-user application, automatic or user-initiated
      checkpoints are delayed until all other sessions have committed or
      rolled back. During a checkpoint, other sessions cannot access the
      database tables but can access the <literal>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</literal>
      system tables.</para>

      <primary>backup</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>The database engine saves the files containing all the data in a
    file catalog when a shutdown takes place. It automatically recovers from
    an abnormal termination and preserves the data when the catalog is opened
    next time. In an ideal operating environment, where there is no OS crash,
    disk failure, bugs in code, etc. there would be no need to backup a
    database. Backing up catalogs is an insurance policy against all sorts of
    misadventure that are not under the control of the database engine.</para>

    <para>The data for each catalog consists of up to 5 files in the same
    directory with the endings such as <literal>*.properties</literal>,
    <literal>*.script</literal>, etc., as detailed in previous
    chapters.</para>

    <simpara>HyperSQL 2 includes commands to backup the database files into a
    single <literal>.tar</literal> or <literal>.tar.gz</literal> file archive,
    or alternatively as copies of the database files. The backup can be
    performed by a command given in a JDBC session if the target database
    catalog is running, or on the command-line if the target catalog has been
    shutdown.</simpara>

    <simpara>It is not recommended to backup the database file with an

      <title>Making Online Backups</title>

      <simpara>To back up a running catalog, obtain a JDBC connection and
      issue a <literal>BACKUP DATABASE</literal> command in SQL. In its most
      simple form, the command format below will backup the database as a

      of backup performs a checkpoint immediately before backing up the

  <section xml:id="mtc_encrypted_database">
    <title>Encrypted Databases</title>

    <para>HyperSQL supports encrypted databases. Encryption services use the
    Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) and uses the ciphers installed with the
    JRE. HyperSQL itself does not contain any cryptography code.</para>

    <para>Three elements are involved in specifying the encryption method and
    key. A cipher, together with its configuration is identified by a string
    which includes the name of the cipher and optional parameters. A provider
    is the fully qualified class name of the cipher provider. A key is
    represented as a hexadecimal string.</para>

    <section xml:id="mtc_encrypted_create">
      <title>Creating and Accessing an Encrypted Database</title>

      <para>First, a key must be created for the desired cipher and
      configuration. This is done by calling the function CRYPT_KEY(&lt;cipher
      spec&gt;, &lt;provider&gt;). If the default provider (the built-in JVM
      ciphers) is used, then NULL should be specified as the provider. The
      CRYPT_KEY function returns a hexadecimal key. The function call can be
      made in any HyperSQL database, so long as the provider class is on the
      classpath. This key can be used to create a new encrypted database.
      Calls to this function always return different keys, based on a
      generated random values.</para>

      <para>As an example, a call to CRYPT_KEY('Blowfish', null) returned the
      string, '604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932'. To create a new database,
      the URL below is used:</para>

      <para><literal>jdbc:hsqldb:file:&lt;database
      path&gt;;crypt_key=604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932;crypt_type=blowfish</literal></para>

      <para>The third property name is crypt_provider. This is specified only
      when the provider is not the default provider.</para>

      <para>HyperSQL works with any symmetric cipher that may be available
      from the JVM.</para>

      <para>The files that are encrypted include the .script, .data, .backup
      and .log files. The .lobs file is not encrypted by default. The property
      crypt_lobs=true must be specified to encrypt the .lobs file. When this
      property is used, the blobs and clobs are both compressed and
      encrypted.</para>

    <section xml:id="mtc_encrypted_speed">
      <title>Speed Considerations</title>

      <para>General operations on an encrypted database are performed the same
      as with any database. However, some operations are significantly slower
      than with the equivalent cleartext database. With MEMORY tables, there
      is no difference to the speed of SELECT statements, but data change
      statements are slower. With CACHED tables, the speed of all statements
      is slower.</para>

      <para>Security considerations for encrypted databases have been
      discussed at length in HSQLDB discussion groups. Development team
      members have commented that encryption is not a panacea for all security
      needs. The following issues should be taken into account:</para>

      <para><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Encrypted files are relatively safe in transport, but
            because databases contain many repeated values and words,
            especially known tokens such as CREATE, INSERT, etc., breaking the
            encryption of a database may be simpler than an unknown
            file.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Only the files are encrypted, not the memory image. Poking
            into computer memory, while the database is open, will expose the
            contents of the database.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>HyperSQL is open source. Someone who has the key, can
            compile and use a modified version of the program that saves a
            full cleartext dump of an encrypted database</para>
          </listitem>

    <section xml:id="mtc_external_monitoring">
      <title>External Statement Level Monitoring</title>

      <para>Statement level monitoring allows you to gather statistics about
      executed statements. HyperSQL is supported by the monitoring tool JAMon
      (Java Application Monitor). JAMon is currently developed as the
      SourceForge project, jamonapi.</para>

      <para>JAMon works at the JDBC level. It can monitor and gather
      statistics on different types of executed statements or other JDBC
      calls.</para>

      logged, there is an impact on speed. So you should only use this for
      debugging. Two levels of sql logging are supported.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="mtc_internal_event_monitoring">
      <title>Internal Event Monitoring</title>

      <para>HyperSQL can log important internal events of the engine. These
      events occur during the operation of the engine, and are not always
      coupled with the exact type of statement being executed. Normal events
      such as opening and closing of files, or errors such as OutOfMemory
      conditions are examples of logged events.</para>

      <para>HyperSQL supports two methods of logging. One method is specific
      to the individual database and is managed internally by HyperSQL. The
      other method is specific to JVM and is managed by a logging
      framework.</para>

      <para>The internally-generated, individual log for the database can be
      enabled with the <literal>SET DATABASE EVENT LOG LEVEL</literal>
      statement, described in this chapter. This method of logging is very
      useful for desktop application deployment, as it provides an ongoing
      record of database operations.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="mtc_jdc_logging">
      <title>Log4J and JDK logging</title>

      <para>HyperSQL also supports log4J and JDK logging. The same event
      information that is passed to the internal log, is passed to external
      logging frameworks. These frameworks are typically configured outside
      HyperSQL. The log messages include the string "hsqldb.db." followed by
      the unique id (a 16 character string) of the database that generated the
      message, so they can be identified in a multi-database server
      context.</para>

      <para>As the default JDK logging framework has several shortcomings,
      HyperSQL configures this logging framework for better operation. If you
      do not want HyperSQL to configure the JDK logging framework, you should
      include the system level property

      <title>Security Defaults</title>

      <para>The default setting are generally adequate for most embedded use
      of the database or for servers on the host that are accessed from the
      same machine. For servers accessed within a network, and especially for
      those accessed from outside the network, additional security settings
      must be used.</para>

      <para>The default settings for server and web server do not use SSL or
      IP access control lists. These features are enabled programatically, or
      with the properties used to start the server.</para>

      <para>The default settings allow a database user with the DBA role or
      with schema creation role to access static functions on the classpath.
      You can disable this feature or limit it to specific classes and
      methods. This can be done programatically or by setting a system
      property when you start a server.</para>

      <para>If access to specific static functions is granted, then these
      functions must be considered as part of the database program and checked
      for any security flaws before inclusion in the classpath.</para>

      <para>The default settings do not allow a user to access files outside
      the database directory. This access is for TEXT table source files. You
      can override this programatically or with a system property when you
      start a server.</para>

      <para>The encryption of database file does not utilise any user-supplied
      information for encryption keys. This level of security is outside the
      realm of users and passwords.</para>

      <para>The first user for a new database has the DBA role. This user name

      specified when the database is created by the first connection to the
      database. These settings are then stored in the database.</para>

      <para>The initial user with the DBA role should be used for admin
      purposes only. At least one additional role should be created for normal
      database use in the application and at least one additional user should
      be created and granted this role. The new role should not be given the
      DBA role. It can be given the CREATE_SCHEMA role, which allows it to
      create and access multiple schemas. Alternatively, the user with the DBA

      <simpara>The <literal>&lt;file path&gt;</literal> can be in two forms.
      If the <literal>&lt;file path&gt;</literal> ends with a forward slash,
      it specifies a directory. In this case, an automatic name for the
      archive is generated that includes the date, time and the base name of
      the database. The database is backed up to this archive file in the
      specified directory. The archive is in <literal>.tar.gz</literal> or
      <literal>.tar</literal> format depending on whether it is compressed or
      not.</simpara>

      <simpara>If the <literal>&lt;file path&gt;</literal> does not end with a
      forward slash, it specifies a user-defined file name for the backup
      archive. The file extension must be either <literal>.tar.gz</literal> or
      <literal>.tar</literal> and this must match the compression
      option.</simpara>

      <simpara>The default set of options is COMPRESSED BLOCKING.</simpara>

      <simpara>If SCRIPT is specified, the backup will contain a
      <literal>*.script</literal> file, which contain all the data and
      settings of the database. This type of backup is suitable for smaller
      databases. With larger databases, this takes a long time. When the

      snapshot of all database files.</simpara>

      <simpara>If NOT COMPRESSED is specified, the backup is a tar file,
      without compression. Otherwise, it is in gzip format.</simpara>

      <simpara>The qualifier, BLOCKING, means all database operations are
      suspended during backup. During backup, a CHECKPOINT command is silently
      executed. This mode is always used when SCRIPT is specified.</simpara>

      <simpara>Hot backup is performed if NOT BLOCKING is specified. In this
      mode, the database can be used during backup. This mode should only be
      used with very large databases. A hot backup set is less compact and
      takes longer to restore and use than a normal backup set produced with
      the BLOCKING option. You can perform a CHECKPOINT just before a hot
      backup in order to reduce the size of the backup set.</simpara>

      <simpara>If AS FILES is specified, the database files are copied to a
      directory specified by &lt;file path&gt; without any compression. The
      file path must be a directory. If the directory does not exist, it is
