<h2>HyperSQL 1.9 Release Candidate 4</h2>
<p>16 July 2009</p>
<p>This is the RC (release candidate) version of HyperSQL 1.9 (it is released 
  after Beta 3, hence labeled RC 4). Please use this version in testing and report 
  any issues.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>We are releasing this RC version only to get feedback, bug reports, reports 
  about migration from older versions, and related information from our users.</p>
<p>Please do use this RC version in tests as soon as possible, and let us know 
  of your findings, via direct email, or posting to our user list or forums, or 
  filing a bug report.</p>
<p>This version is generally stable. If your tests indicate you can use it for 
  your application, please let us know. If there are any issues, this is the last 
  chance to get the issues fixed quickly before the general release, so please 
  let us know as soon as possible. The database file format will not change for 
  the general release. <br>
</p>
<h3>Release plan.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The GA (General Availability) version will be released later this month.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features in this RC version and changes from the first alpha</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All errors and minor issues reported by users have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Sources can be compiled with JDK 1.5 or 1.6</li>
  <li>New features for incremental backup of the .data file allow speedy handling 
    of huge databases up to 16GB.</li>
  <li>Database files created with Alpha and Beta versions cannot be opened with 
    this version without manual modification. It is recommended not to use old 
    Alpha and Beta databases with this version.</li>
  <li>This version persists BLOB and CLOB values. A database file with the extension 
    .lobs is used for LOB objects. LOB support is now transactional. Operations 
    on lobs, including modifying the contents of an existing lobs, should work 
    and can be rolled back. The maximum total size of LOBs is currently 16TB. 
    Access speed looks very good in our tests.</li>
  <li>This version lacks some minor features of System Tables for SQL stored procedures 
    and functions. These will be completed for the release..</li>
  <li>This version has been compiled with debug information. The jar size is therefore 
    much larger than the forthcoming release version. The jar can be used with 
    JDK 1.6 only.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences to version 1.8.0</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are very many new features in the new version. Most of these do not 
    affect existing features.</li>
  <li>For use with existing applications, the main differences are as follows:</li>
  <li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE 
    modes are supported.</li>
  <li>SQL keywords are enforced in some places, therefore some table names or 
    column names may not be acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The new Guide is included in the package and is a must-read. It has been 
    completely rewritten compared to version 1.8.0. The Guide will be enhanced 
    further for the General Availability release.</li>
