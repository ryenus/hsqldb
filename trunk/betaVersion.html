<h2>HyperSQL 1.9 Beta 3</h2>
<p>9 June 2009</p>
<p>This is the first beta release of HyperSQL 1.9 (it is released after Alpha 
  1 and Alpha 2, hence labeled Beta 3). Please use this version in testing and 
  report any issues.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>We are releasing this betaa version only to get feedback, bug reports, reports 
  about migration from older versions, and related information from our users.</p>
<p>Please do use this beta version in tests as soon as possible, and let us know 
  of your findings, via direct email, or posting to our user list or forums, or 
  filing a bug report.</p>
<p>Although this version is generally stable, it should not be used in production. 
  The database file format will change slightly before the final release and it 
  will be impossible to open files created with the alpha and beta versions without 
  manual modifications. </p>
<h3>Release plan.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Depending on user feedback, there may be a further beta version in the next 
    few weeks.</li>
  <li>A release candidate version will be released in June.</li>
  <li>The release version has been scheduled soon after the release candidate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known missing features in this beta version and changes from the first alpha</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most errors and minor issues reported by users have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Sources can be compiled with JDK 1.5 or 1.6</li>
  <li>New features for incremental backup of the .data file allow speedy handling 
    of huge databases up to 16GB.</li>
  <li>Database files created with Alpha 1 cannot be opened with this version without 
    manual modification. The statements for creating the SYSTEM_LOBS schema and 
    its tables and procedures should be deleted fromt the .script file before 
    opening the database.</li>
  <li>This beta version persists BLOB and CLOB values. A database file with the 
    extension .lobs is used for LOB objects. LOB support is now transactional. 
    Operations on lobs, including modifying the contents of an existing lobs, 
    should work and can be rolled back. The maximum total size of LOBs is currently 
    16TB. Access speed looks very good in our tests.</li>
  <li>This beta version lacks some minor features planned for Java and SQL stored 
    procedures and functions. System tables related to these features do exist 
    but some are not yet fully populated.</li>
  <li>This beta version has been compiled with debug information. The jar size 
    is therefore much larger than the forthcoming release version. The jar can 
    be used with JDK 1.6 only.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences to version 1.8.0</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are very many new features in the new version. Most of these do not 
    affect existing features.</li>
  <li>For use with existing applications, the main differences are as follows:</li>
  <li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE 
    modes are supported.</li>
  <li>No blocking for connections set as read-only.</li>
  <li>SQL keywords are enforced in some places, therefore some table names or 
    column names may not be acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The new Guide is included in the package and is a must-read. It has been 
    extensively rewritten and improved compared to version 1.8.0. The Guide will 
    be completed for the release candidate.</li>
