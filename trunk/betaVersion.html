<h2>HyperSQL 1.9 Alpha 2</h2>
<p>1 April 2009</p>
<p>This is the second alpha release of HyperSQL 1.9. Please use this version in 
  testing and report any issues.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>We are releasing this alpha version only to get feedback, bug reports, reports 
  about migration from older versions, and related information from our users.</p>
<p>Please do use this alpha version in tests as soon as possible, and let us know 
  of your findings, via direct email, or posting to our user list or forums, or 
  filing a bug report.</p>
<p>Although this version is generally stable, it should not be used in production. 
  The database file format will change slightly before the final release and it 
  will be impossible to open files created with the alpha versions without manual 
  modifications. </p>
<h3>Release plan.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Depending on user feedback, there may be a further alpha version in the 
    next few weeks.</li>
  <li>A beta version will be released in April. There may be a further beta version 
    after a week or two.</li>
  <li>The release version has been scheduled for May.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known missing features in this alpha version and changes from the last alpha</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Most errors and minor issues reported by users have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Sources can be compiled with JDK 1.5 or 1.6</li>
  <li>New features for incremental backup of the .data file allow speedy handling 
    of huge databases up to 16GB.</li>
  <li>Database files created with Alpha 1 cannot be opened with this alpha without 
    manual modification. The statements for creating the SYSTEM_LOBS schema and 
    its tables and procedures should be deleted fromt the .script file before 
    opening the database.</li>
  <li>This alpha version persists BLOB and CLOB values. A database file with the 
    extension .lobs is used for LOB objects. LOB support is not yet transactional. 
    Therefore only one connection at a time can safely work on LOB objects in 
    transactions. When the transaction is committed, or in auto-commit, the lob 
    values are stored correctly. Apart from that, operations on lobs, including 
    modifying the contents of an existing lobs, should work and can be rolled 
    back. The maximum total size of LOBs is currently 32TB. Access speed looks 
    very good in our tests.</li>
  <li>This alpha version lacks some minor features planned for Java and SQL stored 
    procedures and functions.</li>
  <li>This alpha version has been compiled with debug information. The jar size 
    is therefore much larger than the forthcoming release version. The jar can 
    be used with JDK 1.6 only.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences to version 1.8.0</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are very many new features in the new version. Most of these do not 
    affect existing features.</li>
  <li>For use with existing applications, the main differences are as follows:</li>
  <li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE 
    modes are supported.</li>
  <li>No blocking for connections set as read-only.</li>
  <li>SQL keywords are enforced in some places, therefore some table names or 
    column names may not be acceptable.</li>
