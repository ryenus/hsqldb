<h3>Release plan.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The GA (General Availability) version will be released later this month.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features in this RC version and changes from the first&nbsp;RC version</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All errors and minor issues reported by users have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Sources can be compiled with JDK 1.5 or 1.6</li>
  <li>Many enhancements and additional features</li>
  <li>New features for incremental backup of the .data file allow speedy handling
    of huge databases up to 16GB by default (up to 256GB maximum).</li>
  <li>This version has been compiled with debug information. The jar size is therefore
    much larger than the forthcoming release version. The jar can be used with
    JDK 1.6 only.</li>
  <li>Support for MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control) is functional in this version.
    Therefore it is designated as version 2.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences to version 1.8.0</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are very many new features in the new version. Most of these do not
    affect existing features.</li>
  <li>For use with existing applications, the main differences are as follows:</li>
  <li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE
    modes are supported.</li>
  <li>SQL keywords are enforced in some places, therefore some table names or
    column names may not be acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The new Guide is included in the package and is a must-read. It has been
    completely rewritten compared to version 1.8.0. The Guide will be enhanced
    further for the General Availability release.</li>
