    <h3>HyperSQL version 2.6.1 Distribution<br>
    </h3>
    <p>HSQLDB (HyperSQL Database) is a relational
      database management system written in Java. Now in its 20th year,
      HSQLDB version 2.6.1 is the result of 16 years development since
      version 1.8.0, and 11 years
      improvements over version 2.0. It offers many features and
      adheres closely to the latest SQL and JDBC 4.2 standards.</p>
    <p>This release should be used in preference to earlier 2.x
      releases, as it fixes a number of bugs and regressions, as well as
      improving functionality and adding new features.</p>
    <p>The main jars in this package are Java module jars and compatible
      with Java 11 and later. The alternative jars are compatible with
      Java 8 and later. The jars have been tested with JRE 8 to 15.
      Version 2.3.9 jar (separate download from the web site) has the
      same features as version 2.6.1 minus the java.time features and
      can be used with Java 6 and 7.

    <h4>CHANGES</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Versions 2.x have evolved over ten years since 2010. This
        version is the most stable and bug-free version in the 2.x
        series.</li>
      <li>Compared to earlier versions, there are many new features and
        changes. Most
        of these do not affect compatibility.</li>
      <li>Differences are detailed in the Guide. The main differences in
        version 2.6.1
        are as follows:</li>
      <li>Transaction management has been improved to allow creation and
        alteration of database objects such as tables
        while other transactions are active. This applies to the default
        LOCKS transaction model.</li>
      <li>Support for Java 8 java.time package classes has been added to
        JDBC classes. This allows accessing TIME ZONE information in
        timestamps and all INTERVAL values.</li>
      <li>Support for Java modules with Java 11.</li>
    </ul>
