<h4>lib</h4>

<p>The jar needed for running HyperSQL
and its GUI utilities (hsqldb.jar) has been pre-built in this
directory. The jar is
compatible with Java version 1.6. The jar for SqlTool (sqltool.jar) is
also in this directory. The extra zip file in the directory is needed only for
recompiling hsqldb and is not required for deployment. </p>

<h4>src</h4>

<p>All source code is in this
directory. </p>

<h4>testrun</h4>

<p>Contains test scripts for the
database engine and SqlTool. These scripts are run by separate test utilities
for the engine and SqlTool</p><h4>CHANGES</h4>

<ul><li>There are very many new features in the new version. Most of these do not
    affect existing features in version 1.8.x.</li><li>For use with existing applications, the main differences are as follows:</li><li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE
    modes are supported.</li><li>GENERATE BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY does not create a primary key. A primary key must be declared explicitly.</li></ul>
