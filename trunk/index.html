<h3>HyperSQL version 2.3.3 Distribution</h3>
<p>HSQLDB (HyperSQL DataBase) is a relational
database engine written in Java. Version 2.3.3 is the result of 9 years
development since version 1.8.0. It offers many features and
adheres closely to the latest SQL and JDBC 4 standards.</p>
<p>This is a point release of version 2.3.
This release should be used in preference to earlier 2.x releases, as it fixes a 
number of bugs and regressions, as well as improving functionality.</p>
<h4>SUPPORTWARE</h4>

is for the few sources that contain code from the closed HypersonicSQL project.</p>
<h4>lib</h4>
<p>The jar needed for running HyperSQL
and its GUI utilities (hsqldb.jar) has been pre-built in this
directory. The jar is
compatible with Java version 1.6. The jar for SqlTool (sqltool.jar) is
also in this directory. The extra zip file in the directory is needed
only for
recompiling hsqldb and is not required for deployment.</p>
<h4>src</h4>
<p>All source code is in this
directory. </p>
<h4>testrun</h4>
<p>Contains test scripts for the
database engine and SqlTool. These scripts are run by separate test
utilities
for the engine and SqlTool</p>
<h4>CHANGES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Versions 2.x have evolved over four years. This version is the most stable and bug-free version in the 2.x series.</li>
<li>Compared to version 1.8, there are many new features and changes. Most
of these do not affect existing features in version 1.8.x.</li>
<li>Differences are detailed in the Guide. The main differences
are as follows:</li>
<li>Transaction isolation is always enforced - READ COMMITTED
and SERIALIZABLE modes are supported.</li>
<li>GENERATE BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY does not create a primary
key. A primary key must be declared explicitly.</li>
<li>Column sizes are enforced, although you can change this and
other properties to some extent.</li>
</ul>
<h4>UPDATES</h4>
<p>We constantly fix reported issues. Please check the web site regularly
for&nbsp;latest updated version and latest information.</p>
<h4>RESOURCES</h4>
<p>Support documentation for HyperSQL including the FAQ and links to resources is available
from <a href="http://hsqldb.org/support">http://hsqldb.org/support</a>
in various forms, including user forums. Support is given to open source developers for using HSQLDB in their products.</p>

<h4>NOTE</h4>
The highly configurable java source code formatter <a href="http://jindent.com">Jindent</a> is used to format the HSQLDB source code.
